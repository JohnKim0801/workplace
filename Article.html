			But for elite Canadian curlers on the men’s side, the only feat more daunting than winning Olympic gold is qualifying for the Olympics in the first place. The Canadian Olympic trials are a meat grinder.
		</p>
			<p> Consider Gushue, who has tried on three occasions to make it back to the Olympics since 2006 — and fallen short each time.The Curling News, a publication based in Toronto, has eight Canadian men’s teams ranked among its top 15 in the world, including three of the top four: teams skipped by Kevin Koe, Mike McEwan and Gushue. (Skips are the players who make the most important shots for their teams and orchestrate game plans.
		But every four years, that depth makes for a tricky challenge. Only one team can advance out of the Canadian trials to represent the country at the Olympics. At this year’s trials, which were attended by thousands of curling fanatics who turned out for the biggest, baddest bonspiel ahead of the Olympics, that spot went to Koe’s four-man squad, which outlasted McEwan and his teammates in the final. Gushue’s team lost to McEwan’s team in the semifinals.</p>

		<p>“Their Olympic trials are the most difficult event in the world,” said John Shuster, a four-time Olympian for the United States and a former bronze medalist. “If your goal is to compete at the Olympics — I mean, for me, it’s fortunate that I’m an American. If I was in Canada, there’s no way I would ever be going to my fourth Olympics.”

			Canada, which is aiming for its fourth straight gold medal in men’s curling, typically packs more curling punch than a 10th-end peel weight. (It’s a curling thing.) After defeating Denmark on Wednesday in their final match of pool play, the Canadians secured a berth in Thursday’s semifinals.
			The team skipped by Brad Jacobs had a losing record in the preliminary round and was promptly eliminated, just four years after winning gold at the 2014 Winter Olympics.

			“It’s a little bit of a crapshoot when it comes down to that one week,” Gushue said. “But that’s the way our system is. I benefited from it in 2006, and I think I probably got burned by it this time around.”
